            Corporate Social Responsibility is strongly connected with the
            principles of Sustainability; an organisation should make decisions
            based not only on financial factors, but also on the social and
            environmental consequences. Therefore it is the core corporate
            responsibility of our Company to practice its corporate values
            through commitment to grow in a socially and environmentally
            responsible way, while meeting the interests of its stakeholders.

            We at Chrisason Fire Protection Limited, believe that reaching out
            to underserved communities is part of our CFPL values. We believe in
            transcending business interests and grappling with the "quality of
            life" challenges that underserved communities face and working
            towards making a meaningful difference to them.

            Our mission is to improve the quality of human life by enabling
            people to do more, feel better and live longer. We intend to provide
            resources in terms of money, medicines, time and equipment to
            nonprofit organisations to focus on programs that are 'innovative,
            sustainable and bring real benefits to those most in need'. Our
            philosophy is to target support to selected programs that are
            innovative, sustainable and which produce tangible results.

            We intend to lend a helping hand to the underprivileged in our
            society through the support of women, children and the aged in the
            areas of Health, Education, Public Sanitation etc. Implementing this
            philosophy in spirit, we shall make a positive contribution to the
            communities in which we operate, and invest in health and education
