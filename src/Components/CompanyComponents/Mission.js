              Designing, building, installing and maintaining a fire system is
              all about the knowledge and expertise of the individuals carrying
              out the work. It takes many years of experience to be able to
              properly evaluate the requirements of an organisation, however
              large or small, and be able to tailor the most suitable solution.
              At Chrisason Fire we have a team with many years of time-served
              experience under their belts. Having worked within the fire system
              installation profession for decades we have dealt with all major
              systems and manufacturers and seen how new techniques have evolved
              over the years.
              <br />
              <br />
              We have also seen how health and safety legislation has
              dramatically affected the way businesses need to look at their
              fire prevention systems in order to remain compliant, as well as
              safe. To bring that expertise to you we adopt a very
              straightforward, pragmatic approach. When you first contact us,
              one of our highly qualified team will visit your premises for an
              initial discussion about your needs and the reasons for installing
              a new or upgraded fire system. Is it because you have recognised a
              need to apply greater protection to your business? Are you
              concerned about compliance with the law? Are you looking for a
              more cost-effective solution to the one in place currently?
              Chrisason Fire can help!
